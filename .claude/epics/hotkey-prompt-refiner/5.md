# Task: Cross-platform Testing and Refinement

## Description
Test the complete application on Windows and Linux platforms, identify platform-specific issues, and implement fixes to ensure functional support on all three platforms (macOS primary, Windows/Linux secondary).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application compiles successfully on Windows
- [ ] Application compiles successfully on Linux
- [ ] Core workflow (hotkey → clipboard → API → paste) works on Windows
- [ ] Core workflow works on Linux
- [ ] Platform-specific issues documented and fixed
- [ ] Hotkey combinations adjusted for each platform (Cmd vs Ctrl)
- [ ] Clear error messages for platform-specific permission issues

## Technical Details
**Testing checklist per platform:**

**Windows:**
- Compile with `cargo build --release`
- Test hotkey registration (Ctrl+Shift+P)
- Test clipboard capture
- Test auto-paste (Ctrl+V simulation)
- Verify binary size and memory usage

**Linux:**
- Compile on X11 and Wayland if possible
- Test hotkey registration
- Test clipboard access (X11/Wayland differences)
- Test auto-paste mechanism
- Document display server requirements

**Common issues to address:**
- Hotkey modifier keys (Cmd vs Ctrl vs Alt)
- Clipboard API differences
- Keystroke simulation reliability
- Permission requirements per platform

**Platform-specific code:**
```rust
#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
// macOS-specific implementation

#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
// Windows-specific implementation

#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
// Linux-specific implementation
```

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 007 (Complete Workflow) - must work on macOS first
- [ ] Access to Windows and Linux test environments

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8-12 hours (including testing and fixes)
- Parallel: false (requires completed macOS implementation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Application compiles and runs on all three platforms
- [ ] Core workflow functional on Windows and Linux
- [ ] Platform-specific issues fixed or documented
- [ ] README updated with platform-specific setup instructions
- [ ] Known limitations documented per platform
