# Task: Project Setup and Dependencies

## Description
Initialize Rust project with Cargo, configure all necessary dependencies, and set up the development environment for building a lightweight cross-platform desktop application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cargo project initialized with proper directory structure
- [ ] All required crates added to Cargo.toml (global-hotkey, arboard, reqwest, serde_json, enigo, dotenv, tokio)
- [ ] Cargo.toml configured with release optimizations (opt-level="z", lto=true, strip=true)
- [ ] Basic main.rs with minimal hello-world style startup
- [ ] Project compiles successfully on macOS
- [ ] .env.example file created with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY placeholder

## Technical Details
**Dependencies to add:**
- `global-hotkey` - System-wide hotkey registration
- `arboard` - Clipboard access
- `reqwest` - HTTP client for direct Anthropic API communication
- `serde_json` - JSON serialization/deserialization for API requests/responses
- `enigo` - Keyboard simulation
- `dotenv` - Environment variable management
- `tokio` - Async runtime (with minimal features)

**Cargo.toml profile settings:**
```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"
lto = true
strip = true
codegen-units = 1
```

**Files to create:**
- `src/main.rs` - Entry point
- `.env.example` - API key template
- `.gitignore` - Exclude .env, target/

## Dependencies
- [ ] Rust toolchain installed (1.70+)
- [ ] No other task dependencies

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2-4 hours
- Parallel: false (must be done first)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code compiles with `cargo build --release`
- [ ] Binary size is reasonable (baseline measurement)
- [ ] Project structure ready for feature implementation
- [ ] Documentation added to README about setup
