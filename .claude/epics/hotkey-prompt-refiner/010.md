# Task: Documentation and User Guide

## Description
Create comprehensive documentation including README, setup instructions, usage guide, troubleshooting, and development notes. Ensure users can easily install, configure, and use the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] README.md with project overview and quick start
- [ ] Detailed setup instructions for all platforms
- [ ] Configuration guide (API key, prompt templates)
- [ ] Usage instructions with examples
- [ ] Troubleshooting section for common issues
- [ ] Platform-specific notes (permissions, limitations)
- [ ] Development setup guide for contributors

## Technical Details
**README.md structure:**

```markdown
# Hotkey Prompt Refiner

Lightweight desktop tool for AI-powered text processing via global hotkeys.

## Features
- Global hotkey activation
- Clipboard-based text processing
- Claude API integration
- Auto-paste at cursor

## Installation
### macOS
1. Download latest release
2. Move to Applications
3. Grant Accessibility permissions

### Windows / Linux
[Platform-specific instructions]

## Configuration
1. Get Anthropic API key
2. Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
3. (Optional) Customize prompt template

## Usage
1. Copy text to clipboard
2. Press Cmd+Shift+P (or Ctrl+Shift+P)
3. Wait for AI response to paste

## Troubleshooting
- "Accessibility permissions required" (macOS)
- "API key not found"
- "Hotkey already registered"

## Performance

- Contributing guidelines

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 007 (Complete Workflow) - need working app to document
- [ ] Task 008 (Cross-platform) - need platform-specific notes

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true (can write alongside final testing)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] README.md complete and reviewed
- [ ] Setup instructions tested on each platform
- [ ] All configuration options documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting covers common issues
- [ ] Code comments added to complex sections
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for clarity and accuracy
