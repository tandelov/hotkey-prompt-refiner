# Task: Documentation and User Guide

## Description
Create comprehensive documentation including README, setup instructions, usage guide, troubleshooting, and development notes. Ensure users can easily install, configure, and use the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] README.md with project overview and quick start
- [x] Detailed setup instructions for all platforms
- [x] Configuration guide (API key, prompt templates)
- [x] Usage instructions with examples
- [x] Troubleshooting section for common issues
- [x] Platform-specific notes (permissions, limitations)
- [x] Development setup guide for contributors

## Technical Details
**README.md structure:**

```markdown
# Hotkey Prompt Refiner

Lightweight desktop tool for AI-powered text processing via global hotkeys.

## Features
- Global hotkey activation
- Clipboard-based text processing

2. Set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable
3. (Optional) Customize prompt template

## Usage
1. Copy text to clipboard
2. Press Cmd+Shift+P (or Ctrl+Shift+P)
3. Wait for AI response to paste

## Troubleshooting
