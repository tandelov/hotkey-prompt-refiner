# Task: Tauri project scaffolding and Svelte UI setup

## Description

Initialize the Tauri 2.x project structure with Vite and Svelte frontend framework. Set up the basic UI shell with routing infrastructure to support Settings and History views. Configure the project directory structure to separate Rust backend (`src/`) from frontend code (`src-ui/`), and establish the build tooling pipeline for development and production builds.

This foundational task creates the skeleton that all subsequent UI development will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tauri 2.x project successfully initialized with Vite + Svelte
- [ ] Basic routing implemented with placeholder Settings and History views
- [ ] Project structure established with `src-ui/` directory for frontend code
- [ ] Development server runs successfully with hot reload
- [ ] Production build generates functional application bundle

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Install Tauri CLI and initialize project using `create-tauri-app`
2. Select Vite + Svelte as frontend template
3. Configure `tauri.conf.json` for application metadata and window settings
4. Set up Svelte Router (svelte-routing or similar) for view navigation
5. Create placeholder components for Settings and History views
6. Configure Vite build settings for optimal bundle size
7. Test development and production build workflows

**Files Affected:**
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Tauri configuration
- `src-ui/` - New directory for all frontend code
  - `src-ui/App.svelte` - Root application component with router
  - `src-ui/views/Settings.svelte` - Settings view placeholder
  - `src-ui/views/History.svelte` - History view placeholder
  - `src-ui/main.js` - Frontend entry point
- `vite.config.js` - Vite build configuration
- `package.json` - Frontend dependencies
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Updated Tauri dependencies

**Technology Stack:**
- Tauri 2.x
- Vite 5.x
- Svelte 4.x
- svelte-routing or similar routing library

## Dependencies

### Task Dependencies
- [ ] None - This is a foundational task

### External Dependencies
- [ ] Node.js 18+ and npm/pnpm installed
- [ ] Rust toolchain installed
- [ ] Tauri system dependencies installed (per platform)

## Effort Estimate

**Size:** M

**Hours:** 4-6 hours

**Parallel:** true (can run in parallel with Task 21)

**Breakdown:**
- Tauri initialization and configuration: 1-2 hours
- Svelte routing setup: 1-2 hours
- Project structure organization: 1 hour
- Testing and documentation: 1 hour

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code compiles and runs without errors
- [ ] Development server starts and hot reload works
- [ ] Production build succeeds and application launches
- [ ] Routing navigates between Settings and History views
- [ ] Project structure follows established patterns
- [ ] Build configuration optimized for performance
- [ ] README updated with setup and development instructions
- [ ] Code reviewed and committed to version control
