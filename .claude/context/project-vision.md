# Project Vision: Hotkey Prompt Refiner

## Vision Statement
Create the fastest, most seamless way to integrate AI-powered text processing into everyday workflows, enabling users to enhance their text with a single keystroke without ever leaving their current application.

## Long-term Vision

### The Future of Seamless AI Integration
Hotkey Prompt Refiner aims to become the de facto standard for instant, context-aware AI text processing on desktop platforms. Just as copy-paste became second nature, we envision AI-enhanced text processing becoming an invisible, instant part of every user's workflow.

### 3-5 Year Vision
By 2027-2029, Hotkey Prompt Refiner should:
- Be the go-to tool for developers, writers, and power users who need instant AI assistance
- Support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Offer intelligent context awareness (detect file type, application, selected text)
- Provide sub-100ms perceived response time through streaming and caching
- Have zero-configuration setup for common use cases
- Support collaborative prompts and community-shared templates

## Strategic Direction

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current - Q2 2025) ✅

**Focus**: Prove the concept and establish reliable core functionality
- ✅ Working global hotkey system across platforms
- ✅ Reliable clipboard integration
- ✅ Direct API integration with Claude
- ✅ Auto-paste functionality
- ✅ Basic configuration system
- ⏳ Cross-platform stability

**Success Metric**: Users can reliably process text with a hotkey on their primary platform

### Phase 2: Polish & Flexibility (Q3-Q4 2025)
**Focus**: Make it production-ready and user-friendly

**Planned Features**:
- Configurable hotkeys (no code changes required)
- Multiple prompt templates with quick-switching
- Streaming API responses for faster perceived performance
- Improved error handling and recovery
- System tray/menu bar integration

**Success Metric**: Non-technical users can install and configure without documentation

### Phase 3: Intelligence & Context (2026)
**Focus**: Make the tool context-aware and intelligent

**Planned Features**:
- Automatic prompt selection based on context (file type, application)
- Smart clipboard parsing (detect code, prose, data)
- Workspace/project-specific configurations
- Template marketplace or sharing system
- Response history with search
- A/B testing different prompts
- Local LLM support for privacy-sensitive workflows

**Success Metric**: 80% of invocations use the right template automatically

### Phase 4: Collaboration & Ecosystem (2027+)
**Focus**: Build community and integrations

**Planned Features**:
- Plugin system for custom processors
- Team prompt sharing and versioning
- IDE integrations (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.)
- Browser extension for web-based workflows
- API for third-party integrations
- Prompt analytics and optimization suggestions
- Multi-modal support (images, code, diagrams)

**Success Metric**: Active community contributing templates and plugins

## Core Principles

### 1. Speed Above All
Every feature must be evaluated against latency impact. If it adds >50ms to the critical path, it needs exceptional justification.

**Implications**:
- Aggressive caching strategies
- Streaming responses when possible
- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Zero blocking UI operations

### 2. Invisible by Default
The best tool is one you never think about—it just works.

**Implications**:
- Minimal configuration required for common use cases
- Self-healing error recovery where possible
- Smart defaults that work for 90% of users
- Clear, actionable error messages when something does go wrong

### 3. Privacy First
User data never leaves their machine except the explicit text sent to the AI API.

**Implications**:
- No telemetry without explicit opt-in
- No cloud sync of sensitive data
- Support for local LLMs
- Clear data flow documentation
- Audit trail of API calls (optional)

### 4. Power User Friendly
While simple by default, provide deep customization for advanced users.

**Implications**:
- Configuration via files (not just GUI)
- Scriptable workflows
- API for automation
- Open architecture for extensions

### 5. Platform Native
Respect platform conventions and integrate naturally with OS features.

**Implications**:
- Use native shortcuts and patterns per platform
- System tray/menu bar integration
- Accessibility API support
- Installer follows platform conventions

## Technical Vision

### Architecture Evolution

**Current State**: Monolithic binary with direct API calls
- Single-threaded event loop for hotkeys
- Worker thread for async operations
- Direct HTTP to Claude API

**Near Future (2025)**: Modular architecture with plugin support
- Core engine as library
- Pluggable AI providers
- Template engine separate from core
- Configuration management layer

**Long-term (2026+)**: Distributed, intelligent system
- Local inference for instant suggestions
- Cloud API for complex processing
- Hybrid mode: fast local + comprehensive cloud
- Edge caching and prediction

### Technology Strategy

**Current Tech Stack**: Rust with minimal dependencies
- Maintain Rust core for performance and safety
- Evaluate WebAssembly for plugin system (safe, sandboxed)
- Consider Tauri for future GUI needs (web tech, Rust backend)

**AI Provider Strategy**:
- Start with Anthropic (current)
- Add OpenAI support (Q3 2025)
- Add local model support via llama.cpp or similar (Q4 2025)
- Abstract provider interface for future additions

**Platform Strategy**:
- macOS: Primary platform, first to get new features
- Linux: Strong support for developer users
- Windows: Full parity for broad adoption
- Mobile: Potential future exploration via clipboard sync

## User Experience Vision

### Ideal User Journey (2027)

**First Launch**:
1. User downloads single installer
2. Runs installer—auto-detects API keys from environment
3. App shows welcome with single example: "Try copying text and pressing Cmd+Shift+]"
4. Success on first try, user is productive in 30 seconds

**Daily Usage**:
1. User copies text (code, prose, data)
2. Presses hotkey
3. Appropriate prompt auto-selected based on context
4. Response appears <500ms later (streaming, feels instant)
5. User continues work without breaking flow

**Advanced Usage**:
- User creates custom prompts in simple text files
- Shares favorite prompts with team via git repo
- Uses workspace-specific configs for different projects
- Builds custom processor plugins for domain-specific needs

## Competitive Positioning

- Integration marketplace or keep it simple?

## Conclusion

Hotkey Prompt Refiner is more than a utility—it's a vision for how AI should integrate into our daily work: fast, invisible, and empowering. By staying focused on speed, privacy, and user experience, we aim to build the tool that becomes an indispensable part of every knowledge worker's toolkit.

The journey from simple clipboard processor to intelligent, context-aware AI assistant will take time, but each phase builds on solid foundations and real user value. We're building the future of human-AI interaction, one keystroke at a time.
